### Project Description
A lighthearted web app that scans for ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù in people and shows a randomly generated negativity level, complete with warnings or positive affirmations.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you meet people and feel strange energy‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt measure it. Science fails, vibes prevail!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a Negative Aura Detector that instantly reveals a ‚ÄúNegativity Level‚Äù percentage so you know whether to approach, avoid, or run!
